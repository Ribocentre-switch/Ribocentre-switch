      <p>The RNA world hypothesis for the early development of life on the planet requires that RNA molecules (ribozymes) could have catalysed a wide variety of chemical reactions. Known ribozymes in contemporary biology carry out a limited range of chemical catalysis, mostly involving phosphoryl transfer, but in vitro selection has generated species catalysing a broader range of chemistry. To gauge the feasibility of an RNA world it is useful to explore if ribozymes can exploit sophisticated catalytic strategies.<br> 
      A ribozyme has recently been selected that can catalyse a methyl transfer reaction using O6-methylguanine as donor. With Huang Lin’s lab have solved the crystal structure of this ribozyme at a resolution of 2.3 Å, showing how the RNA folds to generate a very specific binding site for the methyl donor substrate. The structure immediately suggests a catalytic mechanism, involving a combination of proximity and orientation, and nucleobase-mediated general acid catalysis. The mechanism is supported by the pH dependence of the rate of catalysis together with atomic mutagenesis and quantum mechanical calculation. This small chemical machine employs a relatively sophisticated catalytic mechanism, broadening the range of known RNA-catalysed chemistry. This lends new support to the RNA world hypothesis.<br>
      Going still further, how could RNA overcome its relative chemical simplicity and expand its catalytic repertoire? The RNA world would have required a much broader range of RNA catalyzed chemistry, including “difficult” reactions like making C-C bonds. Modern protein enzymes achieve this by using co-enzymes, and perhaps RNA could do the same. RNA is a superb receptor for small molecules, as exemplified by the riboswitches. A significant number of these bind coenzymes, including SAM, TPP, NAD+ and FMN, and it’s not a big leap to imagine that the riboswitch might have evolved from an ancient ribozyme, or might be converted into a novel ribozyme.
